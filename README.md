# Satellite Tracker Web App üõ∞Ô∏è

Welcome to the Satellite Tracker web app repository! This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application that displays the live location of international space satellites. The app leverages the Fetch API to retrieve real-time satellite data and utilizes the open-source map library called Leaflet.js to visualize the satellite positions on an interactive map.

## Features
- **Live Satellite Tracking**: The web app provides a real-time display of the current locations of international space satellites, offering a fascinating view of their orbits around the Earth.

- **Interactive Map Interface**: The interactive map, powered by Leaflet.js, allows users to explore satellite positions, zoom in and out, and pan across the map for a detailed view.

- **Fetch API Integration**: The application fetches live satellite data using the Fetch API, ensuring that the information is up-to-date and accurate.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-tracker.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd satellite-tracker
   ```

3. Launch the web app by opening the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Dependencies
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API): Used to make HTTP requests and retrieve satellite data.

## Usage
Simply open the web app in your browser, and the live satellite positions will be displayed on the map. Explore, zoom in, and enjoy tracking the orbits of international space satellites in real-time!
